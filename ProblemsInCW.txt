-> addItem might have error
-> delete item in Categorty.cpp, never actually gets empty.
-> is getCategory a reference aswell like getitem
-> Do i need to make Item::operator== , it dosent work.
-> for getting entry I am getting the value directly, is that good practice.


[NEW PROBLEMS]
-> lets say I merge map b into  map a, does memory for b clear? or do i still ahve to say b.clear().
-> merge contents of a item in category class, add item
			if exists
				Iterate through second calling inserting into first if key does not exist.
CURRENTLY NOT MERGING

->confusing comment for new category.
-> same merge error in wallet too.
