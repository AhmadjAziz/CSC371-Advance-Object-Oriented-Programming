# 371pass
- Passed test 1 with no errors.
- Passed test 2 with no errors.
- Passing tests in 3/4 except the pertator== error
- currently working on test 3/4. (Need to ask sir questions on Tuesday regarding this).
- No warnings so far in code
- used single line if statements, (as per convention, can ignore brackets if that is the case).
- followed naming conventions seen in slide ( int first_second) no capitals.

- I made my own getEntries in Item so that I can access the entries from category when
trying to merge the contents of item.
